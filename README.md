# Auto Save Textarea Project

This project features a simple webpage with a textarea that automatically saves user input to Local Storage. It also includes a theme dropdown for changing the appearance of the page.

## Features

- **Auto Save Textarea:** User input in the textarea is automatically saved to the Local Storage, allowing users to continue from where they left off even after refreshing the page.

- **Theme Selection:** Users can choose from different themes using the dropdown menu, providing options like Default, Light, Retro, Cyberpunk, Valentine, and Aqua.

## Local Storage Usage

User input is stored in the Local Storage under the key "autoSaveText". If the user returns to the page later, their previous input will be loaded from Local Storage.

## Themes

The themes are applied dynamically to change the visual style of the page. Selecting a theme from the dropdown will instantly update the page's appearance.
